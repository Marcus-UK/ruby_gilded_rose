Gilded Rose Tech Test
=====================

#My approach

This is my submission for the Gilded Rose tech test. To  refactor the code, i have tried to follow a TDD design pattern to extract functionality from the existing code base that will meet specific expectations outlined by
the following user stories:

```
As an inn owner,
so that I can keep track of my stock,
I want to be able to record my inventry.

As an inn owner,
so that I know how long I have to sell stock,
I want to be able to record the number of days I have to sell an item.

As an inn owner,
so that I know how much I can sell an item for,
I want to be able to record the quality of each item.

As an inn owner,
so that I can have up to date information,
I want the inventry system to update each item's values at
the end of each day.
